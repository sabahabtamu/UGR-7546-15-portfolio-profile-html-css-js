                    <p>While software engineering is a significant part of my life, I also enjoy a variety of hobbies. On eof my favorite hobby is cooking different foods. Cooking is a creative and rewarding hobby that allows me to explore new flavors and recipes. It's also a wonderful way to share experiences with family and friends over a home-cooked meal.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading">Skills</h3>
                    <p>As a software engineering student, I have developed a foundation in various programming languages and web technologies. The programming languages that I have developed are HTML5, CSS3, Python, Java and JavaScript. To mention some from these languages:<br> HTML5: Skills using its features such as semantic tags, forms, and multimedia integration (audio, video). <br>CSS3: Skills in styling with CSS3, including working with flexbox and grid layouts. <br>I have also developed some skills on Python, Java and Javascript.</p>
